Many modern artificial intelligence systems are driven by machine learning algorithms. This module teaches the theory and practice of machine learning (also known as data mining or data analytics). You\u2019ll learn the best practice for running a machine learning project and learn the theory behind the most common techniques from regression to neural networks. Systems that automatically make decisions (often about people) based on historical data need to be transparent and fair. This module will also \nconsider the ethical aspects of modern machine learning and how to apply it without bias or inequality.</p>\n        </article>\n        <div class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-12\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Follow the correct methodology for building a machine learning solution.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Evaluate machine learning algorithms to optimise their use for a given problem.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Consider ethical and legal implications when implementing a machine learning solution.</p>\n            </article>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n</div>\n<div class=\"grid-row responsive-padding\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -50px;\">\n    <h3 style=\"padding-left: 12px;\"><strong>Module Content:</strong></h3>\n</div>"
