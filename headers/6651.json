It takes an integrated approach to the area by mixing the theoretical with the applied, through the use of fieldwork in the form of a \"real-world\" study visit, which is supported by prior application in the form of case studies. Topics covered in the module will be drawn from a broad spectrum of Operations Management literature</p>\n        </article>\n        <div class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-4 buv-responsive-video-100\" style=\"padding-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;\"><iframe class=\"lti-embed\" style=\"display: inline-block; border: none;\" title=\"7 AMAZING AI Tools For 2024\" src=\"https://buv.instructuremedia.com/embed/eecd26b3-11c7-42fc-b9d6-6d10e5ea8832\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allow=\"geolocation *; microphone *; camera *; midi *; encrypted-media *; autoplay *; clipboard-write *; display-capture *\" data-studio-resizable=\"true\" data-studio-tray-enabled=\"true\" data-studio-convertible-to-link=\"true\"></iframe></article>\n            <article class=\"col-lg-8\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstration knowledge and understanding of the concepts and principles of service operations management within a tourism and events context.
