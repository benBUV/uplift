That is to say that the learning takes place through personal experience, social interaction, and reflection. The learning programme is reflecting the view that learning can take place outside as well as inside the classroom. Students will be expected to attend several events throughout the module. These events may vary according to student need and timing of the event. These events will add value to the student learning experience and will encourage the students to reflect on learning events outside the classroom.</p>\n        </article>\n        <section class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-4\">\n                <p class=\"buv-responsive-video-100\"><iframe class=\"border-round\" style=\"display: inline-block; border: none;\" src=\"https://buv.instructuremedia.com/embed/3374d596-67f0-432f-8a50-01f8c0fdab1f\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n            </article>\n            <article class=\"col-lg-8\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate competence in the use of written and oral communication skills, both as an individual and in group settings, employing a range of techniques and technologies.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Initiate the compilation of a personal development plan.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Understand the process of critical reasoning and employ that understanding in support of the student's personal development as a learner.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate competence in the use of cognitive skills to the process of retrieving, organising, analysing and critically evaluating information relating to issues in the management of organisations.</p>\n            </article>\n        </section>\n    </section>\n</div>\n<div class=\"grid-row responsive-padding\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -50px;\">\n    <h3 style=\"padding-left: 12px;\"><strong>Module Content:</strong></h3>\n</div>"
