Everyone has examples to illustrate the theory: start thinking now about the best and worst interface design you've encountered. The theoretical work underpins practical exercises in designing, building and testing an interface. Our goal should always be to facilitate easy and successful interactions between people and their computing devices. This module shows you how.</p>\n        </article>\n        <div class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-12\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate critical knowledge of the core concepts in user experience design, also known as human-computer interaction (HCI), and basic cognitive psychology topics relating to HCI.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Analyse the user interface needs for general and specialised real-world software systems and interactive multimedia.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Design user interfaces with a strong focus on the visual aspects of information presentation and satisfying, error-free, user experience, critically-relating design decisions to user characteristics.</p>\n               <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate integrated knowledge of the common techniques and tools for representing and manipulating multimedia components (audio, visual, interaction) on digital computers and the relative advantages of each approach.</p>\n               <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Synthesise practical skills and knowledge by designing and implementing a multimedia user experience.</p>\n            </article>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n</div>\n<div class=\"grid-row responsive-padding\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -50px;\">\n    <h3 style=\"padding-left: 12px;\"><strong>Module Content:</strong></h3>\n</div>"
