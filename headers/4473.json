Once the network is designed well for these technologies other features such as security can then be built upon this. This course will look in detail at the choices within routing and switching to see why design decisions are made and for you to understand these choices. The switching will look at layer 3 switching which is now increasingly being used inside of networks due to the throughput and additional features which can be offered over the traditional layer 2 technology. The emphasis of this course will be from the viewpoint of a medium to large scale organization.</p>\n</article>\n<section class=\"grid-row\">\n<article class=\"col-lg-4 buv-responsive-video-100\" style=\"padding-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;\"><iframe class=\"lti-embed bgcover\" style=\"display: inline-block; border: none; background: #f7f7f7;\" title=\"CT - Routed and Switched Architectures 2\" src=\"https://buv.instructure.com/courses/4473/external_tools/retrieve?display=borderless&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuv.instructuremedia.com%2Flti%2Flaunch%3Fcustom_arc_launch_type%3Dbare_embed%26custom_arc_media_id%3D594df11b-2c68-40cc-a07a-31d24a909fe9-29922%26custom_arc_start_at%3D0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allow=\"geolocation *; microphone *; camera *; midi *; encrypted-media *; autoplay *; clipboard-write *; display-capture *\" data-studio-resizable=\"true\" data-studio-tray-enabled=\"true\" data-studio-convertible-to-link=\"true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></article>\n<article class=\"col-lg-8\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n<h3><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Assess critically the mechanisms and architectural principles of network communications systems.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate critical understanding of the main functions of the OSI data-link layer: switching and redundant paths.
