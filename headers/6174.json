In taking this course, students will have a greater understanding of the conventions and formalities present in academic English alongside developing their ability to create texts and language deemed appropriate for academic purposes. Students will also explore fundamental notions surrounding research such as selecting appropriate sources, identifying stance and perspective, which will better prepare them for their future academic endeavours.</p>\n        </article>\n        <div class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-12\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate awareness of academic conventions in writing and speaking.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Build strategies for working through discipline-specific academic sources.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Apply correct referencing systems in their work aligned with the school\u2019s conventions.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate critical thinking skills in academic contexts.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate basic research skills suitable for tertiary study. </p>\n            </article>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n</div>\n<div class=\"grid-row responsive-padding\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -50px;\">\n    <h3 style=\"padding-left: 12px;\"><strong>Module Content:</strong></h3>\n</div>"
