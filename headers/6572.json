The analysis of digital evidence is a very structured and formal process. This course will allow learners to develop knowledge and understanding of digital forensics, focusing on different platforms (computers, mobile phones, smartphones, and vehicles). The objectives of this course are to introduce the principles of digital forensic investigation both theoretically and practically to students</p>\n        </article>\n        <div class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-12\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>.
