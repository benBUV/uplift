Concepts such as opportunity cost and approaches such as marginal analysis can be widely applied and prove very useful in understanding various aspects of society and people\u2019s lives. The study of economics does not just impart knowledge; it also develops skills such as logical and analytical thinking and problem-solving capabilities, which are useful beyond the formal study of economics. For some of you, economics is not the main area of study, and you may not be intending to pursue a career as an economist. However, we are sure that an understanding of fundamental economic concepts will prove useful to you in whatever direction your studies and subsequent career may take.</p>\n        </article>\n        <section class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-12\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate familiarity with key economic concepts</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Use a range of simple microeconomic and macroeconomic models to analyse the relationship between economic variables.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Provide reasons for, and explain the implications of, market failure and the impact and effectiveness of government policies</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Contrast and assess different approaches to the same economic problem</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Interpret data presented in different formats, carry out simple calculations and construct diagrams</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Compare measures of economic development</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Provide an economic critique of the global financial crisis</p>\n            </article>\n        </section>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"grid-row responsive-padding\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -50px;\">\n    <h3 style=\"padding-left: 12px;\"><strong>Module Content:</strong></h3>\n</div>"
