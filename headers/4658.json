Some theories have been in place for many years and can be applied to many business areas such as human relations, leadership, marketing and systems analysis and are of essential value to managers in problemsolving in the real world. Using these theoretical models, your business knowledge can be applied but always with attention to the individual  circumstances you are examining.</p>\n            <p>In studying business management issues, we also use case studies. These are narratives and explanations of events which took place in certain businesses in the past and that we can use to analyse decision making, the results of these decisions and propose other possibilities which\nwould have had different results had they been implemented. These cases will help you to think in a business management way about the wider implications of your decisions which might occur both inside and outside a company, to understand the fast-moving world of business and to enjoy and learn from discussions with your peers.</p>          \n        </article>\n        <section class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-4 buv-responsive-video-100\" style=\"padding-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;\"><iframe class=\"lti-embed\" style=\"display: inline-block; border: none; background: lightgrey;\"></iframe></article>\n            <article class=\"col-lg-8\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>identify basic business structures and their functions.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>identify risk and major changes in the external business environment and assess the impact of these on business.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>analyse and discuss how managements make their choices regarding strategies and the theoretical models that help these to be implemented succesfully.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>analyse and discuss ways by which businesses can pursue their aims and objectives with effective management of resources including marketing, human resource management, finance and IT.</p>    \n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>provide a business critique of contemporary events, review the options available and recommend actions.</p>             \n            </article>\n        </section>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"grid-row responsive-padding\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -50px;\">\n    <h3 style=\"padding-left: 12px;\"><strong>Module Content:</strong></h3>\n</div>",
