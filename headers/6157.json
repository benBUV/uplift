This involves: identifying a topic of interest, conducting primary and secondary research, including a critical literature review, planning the residue of the work to be done in Level 6, modelling,creating and documenting an artefact that is relevant to your course of study and that is a solution tothe problem set out in your proposal, writing a report describing the technical aspects of the project\u2019s model and artefact, the processes involved in the performance of the project, and critically reflecting on the project\u2019s findings and outcomes, and making a presentation of the technical aspects of the project, including a demonstration of the artefact and a critical evaluation of the project outcomes</p>\n        </article>\n        <section class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-12\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate an understanding of techniques required to design and develop practical artificial intelligence using high level languages.
