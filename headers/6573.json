Hackers often manipulate software vulnerabilities and poor configuration to successfully gain access and steal information. To secure a system it is essential for computer security professionals to understand the structure, configuration, tools and techniques that hackers rely upon to successfully commit their act. It is also important to test the network regularly and discover any vulnerability due to miss configuration or poor patching</p>\n        </article>\n        <div class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-12\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Explain and analyse the stages required by an ethical hacker to compromise a target.
