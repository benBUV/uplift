Usage scenarios include a range of applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, medical imaging, remote sensing for environmental monitoring, security and surveillance and many more. This module will present the understanding of the deep learning-based CV and NLP algorithms that are core to many real-life examples. The practical sessions will provide hands-on experience with various deep learning frameworks. This module includes some key mathematical concepts and uses Python as the main programming language for both lab exercises and the assessment.</p>\n        </article>\n        <div class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-8\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Assess a computer vision or natural language processing problem and identify a suitable solution to the problem.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Choose appropriate technologies with which to build a solution.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Apply the correct methodology to use machine learning to build a solution.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Implement a solution using the appropriate software tools.</p>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Critically assess the legal, social and ethical issues of a machine learning project.</p>\n            </article>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n</div>\n<div class=\"grid-row responsive-padding\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -50px;\">\n    <h3 style=\"padding-left: 12px;\"><strong>Module Content:</strong></h3>\n</div>"
