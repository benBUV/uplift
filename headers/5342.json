This module will explore how events are conceived, designed and delivered across a range of diverse settings. Key to the delivery of a successful event is ensuring access to appropriate resources and therefore the event manager must also understand resourcing requirements for their industry. Event metrics, event networking apps, keynote speakers and event planning software will be considered within the module. Resourcing issues will be analysed for specific events organisations and solutions explored.</p>\n        </article>\n        <div class=\"grid-row\">\n            \n            <article class=\"col-lg-8\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Develop an event concept.
