In this module we will be looking at how corporations have adapted to this changing landscape with the increased reliance on the data which is stored. As data is becoming more important, we need to ensure that everything is stored in a manner which makes it accessible within the timeframe defined by the company and to ensure that it remains secure from people both outside and inside of a company. We will look at the transition which is taking place of moving corporate data and infrastructure to a Cloud based environment and ensuring that this meets the requirements of local legalisation and locally defined security requirements. This module will make use of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academic Learning environment to allow students to build confidence in Cloud computing and cyber security.</p>\n        </article>\n        <div class=\"grid-row\">\n            <article class=\"col-lg-12\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 12px;\">\n                <h3><strong>Learning Objectives for this module:</strong></h3>\n                <p><span style=\"color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;\">+ &nbsp;</span>Demonstrate an understanding of cloud fundamentals.
